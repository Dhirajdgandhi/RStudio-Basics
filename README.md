# RStudio-Basics
Each File presents a Basic Statistic function using R. Below are a few examples that have been coded in respective files.

1) User defined function to calculate mode

2) A vector given as input.
  33 students.
  Standard Deviation = 6.8
  Interpret 95% and 99% confidence interval of the population mean.

3) Use R to simulate 1000 times the sampling distribution of the mean X,1,30,1000 observations from the uniform distribution.Create a         histogram and determine the mean and Standard deviation of these simulations.

4) A student and score vector given of 10 students.
  a) Find mean and Standard deviation of the simulations.
  b) 10 times create sample of size 4.Compute means of all these samples.Construct histogram of these means.
  This is an approximate sample distribution.Find approximate mean and standard deviation of the sample mean X.


5) 12MCQS.Each Question -> 5 possible answers and only 1 correct.
  Find probability of having 4 or less correct answers if a student attempts to answer every question at random.
